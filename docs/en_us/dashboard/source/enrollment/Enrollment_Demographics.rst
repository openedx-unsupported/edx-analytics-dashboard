Enrollment Demographics

Who is taking my course? Demographic data about your enrolled learners helps
quantify characteristics of the people who are taking your course.

EdX Insights delivers demographic data for three population characteristics:
age, educational background, and gender. When learners register an edX or edX
Edge user account, they can provide this information about themselves.

Responses to these questions are optional. Learners can update this information
at any time on the `Account Settings`_ page.

.. note:: EdX Insights does not use the values that learners select from the
 **Country or Region** list to determine learner location. See :ref:`Location
 Computations`.

In edX Insights, after you select **Enrollment** and then **Demographics**, you
can choose **Age**, **Education**, or **Gender** to access a chart, metrics,
and reports to view or download.

The following chapters provide information about the demographic data that edX
Insights presents.

* :ref:`Demographics_Age`
* :ref:`Demographics_Education`
* :ref:`Demographics_Gender`

To review detailed data about all of the enrolled learners in your course, you
can download the learner profile report from the Instructor Dashboard. For more
information, see `Learner Data`_ in *Building & Running an edX Course*.
