To access information about what individual learners are doing in your course,
and how frequently, select **Learners** on the **Course Home** page for the
course. A report of the key activity metrics for all enrolled learners appears,
including problems tried and videos played. You can then review a chart of
individual learner activity over time by selecting a learner by username.

To open the **Course Home** page for any course, sign in to Insights, and then
select the name of the course in the Course List table on the **Courses** page.
