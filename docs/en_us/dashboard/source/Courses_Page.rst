============================================
Identify Courses With the Highest Enrollment
============================================

If you want to find courses with the highest enrollment, you can sort the table
by either the “Total Enrollment” or “Current Enrollment” columns, depending on
the metric that you are interested in. This will help you understand which
courses attract the most learners.

You can sort by the “Verified Enrollment” column to find courses with the
highest number of verified learners.

===============================================
Identify Recent Enrollment Changes for a Course
===============================================

If you are running course marketing campaigns, you may be interested in looking
at recent changes in enrollment. If you sort by the “Change Last Week” column
in descending order, you can see the courses with the greatest increase in
enrollment in the past week. You will need to draw on your knowledge of recent
marketing efforts to interpret this data, and assess the impact of marketing
efforts on course enrollments.

============================================================
Identify Courses With the Highest Number of Passing Learners
============================================================

If you want to find courses with the highest number of learners who currently
have a passing grade in the course, you can sort the table by the “Passing
Learners” column.

=================================
Access Data for a Specific Course
=================================

To access Insights data for a specific course or courses, locate the name of
the course in the Course List table, and then select the course name.

To locate a course in the Course List table, you can use the options in the
left pane to limit the courses that the table lists. You can search by course
name or course ID, and you can filter by availability and pacing type. You can
also combine any of these options.

* In the **Find a Course** field, enter any part of the course name or course
  ID, and then click the search icon.
* Under **Availability** or **Pacing Type**, select the options that you want
  to include in your search. The list of courses updates automatically when you
  select or clear an option.

====================================
Access Data for Courses in a Program
====================================

To access Insights data for the courses in one or more specific programs, such
as XSeries and MicroMasters programs, locate **Programs** in the left pane, and
then select the program or programs that you want. The courses in the program
or programs then appear in the Course List table. You can use the Programs
