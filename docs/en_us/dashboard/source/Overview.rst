Overview of EdX Insights
########################

EdX Insights makes information about courses available to course team members
who have the Staff or Admin role. EdX Insights provides these
course team members with data about learner activity, background, and
performance throughout the course. Using edX Insights can help you monitor how
learners are doing, and validate the choices you made in designing your
course. It can also help you re-evaluate choices and inform efforts to improve
your course and the experience of your learners.

Putting the data provided by edX Insights to work involves:

* Evaluating reported data against your expectations and hypotheses.

* Understanding the context of the course run: the environmental factors and
  choices that make each run unique.

* Deciding whether action is called for.

* Selecting the action to take, and when.

EdX Insights includes a brief description for each reported value. To see these
descriptions, move your cursor over the "i" information icons that appear at
top right of each chart or metric.

This guide is intended to offer more complete information about the data that
edX Insights presents.

* For information about the computation of the values that are reported, see
  the :ref:`Reference` chapter. For a reference to the data that edX collects
  and stores, see the `edX Research Guide`_.

* For an introduction to the graphs, metrics, and reports that you can access
  in edX Insights, see the following topics.

 * :ref:`Course_List`

 * :ref:`Enrollment_Activity`

 * :ref:`Enrollment_Geography`

 * :ref:`Enrollment_Demographics`

 * :ref:`Engagement_Content`

 * :ref:`Engagement_Video`

 * :ref:`Performance_Graded`

 * :ref:`Performance_Ungraded`

Each of these topics contains a section for anecdotal "Analytics in Action".
These sections showcase how collected data can reveal information about
courses and learners, and how course teams might react to the information.

You are invited to share your experiences using edX Insights. Contact the edX
documentation team at `docs@edx.org`_.

.. Measuring the Effectiveness of Bulk Email
.. ==================================================

.. The first time that Professor Ana Bell ran 6.00.1x for MITx, she noticed that learners had a real pain point around homework deadlines. Although reminders were posted in three different parts of the course content, learners just didn't convert the published due date and time from UTC to their local time zones. After the first assignment due date for the Fall 2013 run, Professor Bell fielded almost 80 individual discussion posts from learners who had experienced some time zone confusion.

.. For the Spring 2014 run of the course, Professor Bell decided to use the bulk email feature on the Instructor Dashboard to send reminders to her learners. She sent a message a few hours before every course deadline, and even included a link to a UTC conversion website. After the first assignment, she noticed a significant decrease in the number of discussion posts relating to misunderstood deadlines, down to about 20.

.. Beyond the approximate data that she got from comparing discussion posts, Professor Bell also compared the completion rates for the two runs. From a completion rate of about 6% for the Fall 2013 run of 6.00.1x, the completion rate went up to 7% in Spring 2014. While other variables may have contributed to this increase, Professor Bell believes that the "ongoing heartbeat‚Äù of her weekly messages acted not only to solve the specific problem of missed deadlines, but also as a more general motivator, getting learners to keep visiting the course and looking at the material.
